# Installation
The executable can be ran from anywhere, but it is suggested to copy it alongside **Expedition33\*.exe** (where * is a wildcard, the Steam version is **Expedition33_Steam.exe** for example). Doing this allows launching the game from the configurator.

# Usage
Pretty straight forward, if Engine.ini does not exist, it can be generated from **File >> Create Engine.ini**. This will unlock the various options that will affect the graphics of Clair Obscura. If an Engine.ini already exists, for example from someone elses modifications, this configurator can most likely make use of it as long as the Unreal variables fall within the **`[SystemSettings]`** section of the INI. If they do not, it is suggested to either delete the current INI file if you wish to use this configurator, or ignore this configurator and use the INI you are comfortable with using.

# Other Info
Some options will have a profound effect on graphics, but it's also possible that some options don't have any apparent effect. To make things simple, there are some built-in **Presets** that can be selected for a base configuration. If wanting to use one of the bottom two presets (Sharp & Clear/Soft & Ambient), it is suggested to first choose one that reflects the power of your PC (Low - Ultra). From there the settings can be fine tuned. The menubar **Game** option can launch the game if it's in the game folder alongside the game's executable, and it can also task kill the game process (this may require administrator privelages). It's also possible that Windows will see this application as some kind of virus as it doesn't like apps that mess with running apps. I assure you that it is not, all the code is visible.
